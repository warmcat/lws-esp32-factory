lws-esp32-factory
=================

This is a standalone <1MB image intended for the 1MB "factory" slot on ESP32.

This image is designed to look after two cases

 - Factory bringup, where you push PEM SSL certs to the device and set "factory options"

 - Common user setup, for example teaching the device about your AP passphrase, updating
   your OTA or the factory application, and user setup like device grouping name

Your actual "OTA" application is something completely different, and has its own 2.9MB
flash area.  This -factory app is designed to take care of all common setup stuff and
put it in nvs to be shared with the OTA app.

It has the following capabilities:

### Initial Factory Setup Page

Allows overriding default serial, setting device options string, and uploading PEM SSL certs

![Factory Setup](https://libwebsockets.org/setup3.png)

With an empty nvs, the first time this will come up at http://192.168.4.1 in AP mode, ie at port 80 without SSL, since no SSL certs configured yet.

After the PEM format SSL certs have been uploaded, everything subsequently is in https on port 443.

### User configuration Setup Page

![lws AP mode config page](https://libwebsockets.org/setup2.png)

If no AP information is in the nvs, this page comes up automatically at https://192.168.4.1 in AP mode.

The user can reach it subsequently programmatically or by grounding a GPIO (ie, by a button), the default GPIO is IO14.

The page allows you to select an AP from a scan list and give a passphrase.  It supports four AP slots,
for, eg, home and work environments, and it handles the scan and acquire of the APs.

Once it connects, the DHCP information is shown, and it autonomously connects to a configurable server over https to check for updates.  The user can select to have it autonomously download the update and restart.

The user can also upload images by hand.  The factory image understands how to update both the 1MB factory slot itself and the single 2.9MB OTA slot using autonomous upload from a server or the browser based file upload.

## Optional default peripherals

It's not required, but the default code expects

 - pushbutton to 0V connected on IO14, with pullup to 3.3V

If the pushbutton is held down at boot, the user is forced into the factory / Setup mode rather than the OTA application.

**Note:** Default selection of GPIO14 should be changed to another value when [debugging with JTAG](http://esp-idf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-guides/jtag-debugging/index.html). Pins reserved for ESP32 JTAG: GPIO12, GPIO13, GPIO14 and GPIO15.

 - LED connected via, eg, 330R   3.3V ---|>|-----/\\/\\/\\---- IO23

While in factory / OTA mode, the LED flashes dows a PWM sine cycle at about 1Hz.  When you press "ID Device" button in the UI, the LED does the since cycle rapidly for 10s, so you can be sure which physical device you are talking to.


## Building and using

### Step 0: Install prerequisites

### 0.1: genromfs

For Ubuntu / Debian and Fedora at least, the distro package is called "genromfs"

### 0.2: recent CMake

CMake v2.8 is too old... v3.7+ are known to work OK and probably other intermediate versions are OK.

### 0.3: OSX users: GNU stat

```
     $ brew install coreutils
```

### Step 1: Clone and get lws submodule

```
     $ git clone git@github.com:warmcat/lws-esp32-factory.git
     $ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Step 2: Erase the whole device

Clear down the partitioning since we write a custom table and the bootloader
will choke if the OTA parts are not initialized like this one time

```
 $ make erase_flash
```

## Step 3: General build and flash

First one time each session set an env var in your shell to override the tty port

```
 $ export ESPPORT=/dev/ttyUSB0
```

Then you can just do

```
 $ make flash monitor
```

## Using the Factory Config

 - From scratch, the device is in AP mode with a AP name like config-lws-SERIAL

 - From scratch, the factory app listens at http://192.168.4.1/factory.html

 - build generates a selfsigned PEM cert and key files in build/libwebsockets, `libwebsockets-test-server.pem` and `libwebsockets-test-server.key.pem`.  Use the form to upload these.

 - after the reboot vist https://192.168.4.1, which will take you to the user setup

 - As a security feature, since you can programmatically reboot into factory mode from the OTA application, once the SSL certs are set some features require the "boot into factory" button to be physically pressed during powerup before they can be accessed subsequently.  This limits what a remote attacker can achieve.

## Using the User setup

 - connect your wifi to the ap "lws-config-...."

 - In a browser, go to https://192.168.4.1

 - Click on the radio button for AP slot 1

 - Select your normal AP from the list

 - Give the AP password and click the button

 - Your ESP32 should associate with the AP without resetting

## Using the lws test apps

This application is just the factory / setup application.

The end-user applications are separate projects, see eg

https://github.com/warmcat/lws-esp32-test-server-demos

These are built and loaded slightly differently, ie

```
 $ make flash_ota monitor
```

This is because they target the 2.9MB OTA flash area.

The `build/*.bin` file from the application build may also be uploaded in the setup page upload UI.

NOTE: the first time you flash the OTA application, you need to do it using the
upload file button or the autonomous update facility in the Factory App.  The bootloader
requires it to not only be flashed, but marked as bootable.

Subsequently you can just reflash the OTA partition with `make flash_ota` or use the upload or autonomous update stuff in the -factory app.

## Note for Firefox users

Firefox has a longstanding, unfixed bug dealing with selfsigned certs.  As you add more exceptions for them,
firefox bogs down processing the validity of the certs.  Symptoms are slow (eventually very slow) browser
performance sending data on the accepted SSL connection.

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1056341

Symptom is your browser box's cpu burns while it sits there.  Workaround is to delete the cert8.db file in
your firefox user config, on my box it was `~/.mozilla/firefox/blah.default/cert8.db`.

This isn't related to lws but affects all firefox usage with selfsigned certs...
